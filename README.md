# Haskell Function Definition Order Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: calling a function before it's defined.  This results in a compile-time error because the compiler encounters the function call before the function's definition.

The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.hs` file shows the corrected version.
